# **App Name**: EvoluFace

## Core Features:

- Face Display: Display a human face as a starting point.
- Swipe Transformation: Transform the face into hominid ancestors as the user swipes.
- Gradual Transformation: The face smoothly morphs through different hominid stages.
- Label Generation: Automatically generate labels for each facial transformation stage (e.g., "stronger jaw", "sloping forehead") using an AI tool. The tool has knowledge about human evolution, and will use reasoning to find a suitable fact about a certain hominid form for display in the label.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm beige (#F5F5DC), evoking a sense of history and natural tones.
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE), providing a neutral backdrop that focuses attention on the facial transformations.
- Accent color: Soft brown (#A67B5B), used for labels and interactive elements to enhance readability and tie in with the earthy theme.
- Body and headline font: 'Literata' (serif) for a readable, slightly vintage aesthetic that complements the educational nature of the application.
- Use simple, clear icons for any additional navigation or information buttons. Icons should maintain a consistent style to ensure ease of understanding.
- The face should be centrally located on the screen to immediately grab the user's attention. Labels dynamically appear near relevant facial features.
- Smooth, fluid transitions between facial stages when the user swipes to create an engaging and informative experience.
